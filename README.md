# __Alessor Service__

# Description
My capstone project for my Bachelors Degree. This is part of a Property Management app. It's main functionality is maintence work scheduling, automation of finances, and payment integration.

# Quickstart 
## The easiest way to run the server is to run it with docker
- **but** I have to finish setting that up so..

## Setup server for development mode
- if you my teacher I will give you access to the .env and config.yml files
- add the .env file to the root of the project
- add the config.yml file to the config dir in the root directory

## Run the server in development mode
- run `make run-dev`
- the config sets the server to run on port :8087
